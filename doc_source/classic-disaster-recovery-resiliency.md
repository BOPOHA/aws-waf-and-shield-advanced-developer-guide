# Resilience in AWS WAF Classic<a name="classic-disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. If you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November, 2019, and you have not migrated your web ACLs over yet, you need to use AWS WAF Classic to access those resources\. Otherwise, do not use this version\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones\. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low\-latency, high\-throughput, and highly redundant networking\. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption\. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures\. 

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)\.
