# AWS WAF Limits<a name="limits"></a>

AWS WAF has default limits on the number of entities per account\. You can [request an increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-waf) in these limits\.


| Resource | Default Limit | 
| --- | --- | 
| Web ACLs per AWS account | 50 | 
| Rules per AWS account | 100 | 
| Rate\-based\-rules per AWS account | 5 | 
| Conditions per AWS account | 100 of each condition type \(For example: 100 size constraint conditions, 100 IP match conditions, and so on\. The exception is regex match conditions\. You can have a maximum of 10 regex match conditions per account\. This limit cannot be increased\.\) | 
| Requests per Second | 10,000 per web ACL\* | 

\*This limit applies only to AWS WAF on an Application Load Balancer\.
