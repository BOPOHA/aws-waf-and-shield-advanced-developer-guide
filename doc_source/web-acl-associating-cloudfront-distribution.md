# Associating or Disassociating a Web ACL with an Amazon API Gateway API, a CloudFront Distribution or an Application Load Balancer<a name="web-acl-associating-cloudfront-distribution"></a>

To associate or disassociate a web ACL, perform the applicable procedure\. Note that you also can associate a web ACL with a CloudFront distribution when you create or update the distribution\. For more information, see [Using AWS WAF to Control Access to Your Content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-awswaf.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*\.

The following restrictions apply when associating a web ACL:
+ Web ACLs associated with an Application Load Balancer can be associated only with another Application Load Balancer in the same region\. The same is true for API Gateway APIs\.
+ Web ACLs associated with a CloudFront distribution cannot be associated with an Application Load Balancer\. The web ACL can, however, be associated with other CloudFront distributions\.
+ Each API Gateway API, Application Load Balancer and CloudFront distribution can be associated with only one web ACL\.
