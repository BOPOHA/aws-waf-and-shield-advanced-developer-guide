# Step 1: Complete the prerequisites<a name="classic-complete-prereq"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. If you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November, 2019, and you have not migrated your web ACLs over yet, you need to use AWS WAF Classic to access those resources\. Otherwise, do not use this version\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

There are several mandatory steps to prepare your account for AWS Firewall Manager\. Those steps are described in [AWS Firewall Manager prerequisites](fms-prereq.md)\. Complete all the prerequisites before proceeding to [Step 2: Create rules](classic-get-started-fms-create-rules.md)\.
