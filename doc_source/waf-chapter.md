# AWS WAF<a name="waf-chapter"></a>

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer\. AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content\. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, API Gateway, CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code \(Forbidden\)\. You also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked\.
