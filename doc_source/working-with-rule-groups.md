# Working with Rule Groups<a name="working-with-rule-groups"></a>

A *rule group* is a set of rules that you add to a web ACL or an AWS Firewall Manager policy\. You can create your own rule group, or you can purchase a managed rule group from AWS Marketplace\. For more information, see [AWS Marketplace Rule Groups](waf-managed-rule-groups.md)\.

**Important**  
If you want to add an AWS Marketplace rule group to your policy, each account in your organization must first subscribe to that rule group\. After all accounts have subscribed, you can then add the rule group to a policy\. For more information, see [AWS Marketplace Rule Groups](waf-managed-rule-groups.md)\.
