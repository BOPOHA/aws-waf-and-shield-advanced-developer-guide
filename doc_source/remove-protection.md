You can remove AWS Shield Advanced protection from any of your AWS resources at any time\.

**Remove AWS Shield Advanced protection from an AWS resource**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/wafv2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/)\. 

1. Choose **Protected resources**\.

1. Choose the radio button next to the resource\.

1. Choose **Delete protection**\.

   1. If you have an Amazon CloudWatch alarm configured for this protection, you are given the option to delete the alarm along with the protection\. If you choose not to delete the alarm at this point, you can instead delete it later using the CloudWatch console\.
**Note**  
For protections that have an Amazon RouteÂ 53 health check configured, if you add the protection again later, the protection still includes the health check\. 

The above steps remove AWS Shield Advanced protection from a specific AWS resource\. They don't cancel your AWS Shield Advanced subscription\. You will continue to be charged for the service\.
