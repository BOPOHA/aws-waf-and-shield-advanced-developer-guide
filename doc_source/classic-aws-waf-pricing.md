**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. If you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November, 2019, and you have not migrated your web ACLs over yet, you need to use AWS WAF Classic to access those resources\. Otherwise, do not use this version\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

## <a name="classic-waf-pricing"></a>

With AWS WAF Classic, you pay only for the web ACLs and rules that you create, and for the number of HTTP requests that AWS WAF Classic inspects\. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/)\.
