# AWS Identity and Access Management<a name="classic-aws-waf-iam"></a>

**Note**  
This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation\. If you created AWS WAF resources, like rules and web ACLs, in AWS WAF prior to November, 2019, and you have not migrated your web ACLs over yet, you need to use AWS WAF Classic to access those resources\. Otherwise, do not use this version\.  
**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, see [AWS WAF](waf-chapter.md)\. 

AWS WAF Classic integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), a service that lets your organization do the following:
+ Create users and groups under your organization's AWS account
+ Share your AWS account resources with users in the account
+ Assign unique security credentials to each user
+ Control user access to services and resources

For example, you can use IAM with AWS WAF Classic to control which users in your AWS account can create a new web ACL\.

For general information about IAM, see the following documentation:
