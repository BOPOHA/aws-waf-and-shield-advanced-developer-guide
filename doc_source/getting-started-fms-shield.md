You can use AWS Firewall Manager to enable AWS WAF Classic rules, AWS Shield Advanced protections, and Amazon VPC security groups\. The steps for getting set up are slightly different for each\. If you want to use Firewall Manager to enable AWS WAF Classic rules, follow the steps in [Getting Started with AWS Firewall Manager to Enable AWS WAF Classic Rules](getting-started-fms.md)\. If you want to use Firewall Manager to enable Amazon VPC security groups, follow the steps in [Getting Started with AWS Firewall Manager Amazon VPC Security Group Policies](getting-started-fms-security-group.md)\. 

**Important**  
Firewall Manager does not support Amazon RouteÂ 53 or AWS Global Accelerator\. If you need to protect these resources with Shield Advanced, you can't use a Firewall Manager policy\. Instead, follow the instructions in [Adding AWS Shield Advanced Protection to More AWS Resources](configure-new-protection.md)\.
